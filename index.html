        <p>UP.LOADED aims to explore the nuances of human behaviours through their digital footprints and experiences.</p>
            
         <p>This is a series of experiments which explores my behaviours, and things that Iâ€™ve put online throughout my life through data analysis such as photos, posts and messages. </p>
            
        <p>Every experiment is conducted with data chronologically ordered over the last 10 years from past to present as you progress through each one.</p>
            
        <p>These experiments are accompanied with code poetry which reflects my findings and reflections.</p>
